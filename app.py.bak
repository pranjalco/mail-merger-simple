# Project 18: Mail Merger

## Description:
This program automates the creation of personalized invitation letters. It reads a template letter from a text file,
replaces the [name] placeholder with actual names from another text file, and saves each personalized letter in a
designated folder.

## How to Use:
1. `invited_names_pr.txt` contains the list of names to be used for personalizing the letters.  
2. `starting_letter.txt` contains the message template with a placeholder (e.g., `[name]`) for replacing names.  
3. You can modify the contents of both files (`invited_names_pr.txt` and `starting_letter.txt`) as needed.  
4. Run the program by executing `app.py`.  
5. After running the program, the output text files will be saved in the `Output/ReadyToSend` folder.   

## Level
